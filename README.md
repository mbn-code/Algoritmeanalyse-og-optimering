# Algorithm Analysis and Optimization

Algorithm optimization and analysis along with practical implementations

## Clean and Run

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
.\build\AlgorithmProject.exe
```

## Topic/Concept

**Algorithm optimization and their practical implementations.**

## Angle

I will investigate the commonly used methods for optimizing algorithms and how these methods are classified. Subsequently, I will delve into how mathematics is used to analyze algorithms and their performance.

## Problem Statement

- What is an algorithm?
- How do you analyze an algorithm?
- How can algorithms be analyzed to develop optimized algorithms for practical implementations to save time and computational resources?
- How do you typically calculate and compare time and space complexities in real-world scenarios for algorithms?
- What practical software examples demonstrate that algorithm optimization has benefited the project?

## Subjects

For this project, I intend to use **Programming B** as my study subject and **Mathematics A** as my A-level subject. The reason for using programming is to explain code and demonstrate [...]

## Methodological Considerations for Empirical Data Collection

To gather knowledge, I will use the method of information searching and books. For empirical data and theory, I will read *'Introduction to Algorithms'* (third edition), which provides insights into programming and mathematics [...]

## Sources

Currently, my only source is *'Introduction to Algorithms'*, as I have read most of the book. Otherwise, I find the topic intriguing and would like to explore more.

## Questions

- What are the most common techniques for algorithm optimization, and how can they be classified?
- How does the choice of data structure affect the efficiency of an algorithm?
- What tools and techniques can be used to benchmark and compare different algorithms?
- How can parallelization and caching be used to improve the performance of existing algorithms?
- What practical examples of algorithm optimization exist in large-scale software projects, and what have been the results?
