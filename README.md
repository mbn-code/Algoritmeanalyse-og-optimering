## Introduction

The aim of this project is to investigate commonly used methods for optimizing algorithms and how these methods are classified. It delves into how mathematics is used to analyze algorithms and their performance, specifically focusing on Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Binary Search algorithms.

The project stems from the need to understand how algorithm analysis and optimization can save time and computational resources. Algorithms are fundamental in solving problems efficiently, and optimizing them is crucial in practical applications like search engines, data processing, and more.

## Detailed Analysis

### Sorting Algorithms

- **Quick Sort**: An efficient, in-place sorting algorithm using the divide-and-conquer approach. It selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the array around the pivot. While it has an average-case time complexity of O(n log n), the worst-case performance is O(nÂ²).

  - [GeeksforGeeks - Quick Sort Complexity](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/time-and-space-complexity-analysis-of-quick-sort/)  

- **Merge Sort**: A stable, comparison-based sorting algorithm that consistently performs at O(n log n) time complexity for all cases. It divides the array into halves, sorts them recursively, and then merges the sorted halves.

### Searching Algorithms

- **Binary Search**: An efficient algorithm for finding an item in a sorted array with a time complexity of O(log n).
